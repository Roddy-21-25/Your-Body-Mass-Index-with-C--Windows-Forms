# Your-Body-Mass-Index-with-C-Windows-Forms
This is my First Practice with C# and Windows Forms, at present i am watching a course, and the teacher let me this homework for to know the basics of the language.


I have to say something:

first, this is my first time uploading c# files to github, so, sorry if i did something wrong jjj :)
and second, for to run this code, you will need to know:
- how tall you are? and your weight? 

once you know that, you can run and check if you hace good health.

And the last, there are two project in c# in this chapter, one is "Form 1", this is the practice, don't think too much about it, the second one is, "Check your Body Mass Index", this is the correct.

btw, i will let you some examples if you want to check all the if that i use in this code, and know if i did this homework well:

Underweight or Low: BMI < 18.5
Weight: 50kg
Height: 1.7m
BMI = 50 / (1.7^2) ≈ 17.3

Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 25
Weight: 65kg
Height: 1.75m
BMI = 65 / (1.75^2) ≈ 21.2

Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30
Weight: 93kg
Height: 1.8m
BMI = 93 / (1.8^2) ≈ 28.7

Obesity: BMI >= 30
Weight: 95kg
Height: 1.65m
BMI = 95 / (1.65^2) ≈ 34.9

Have a nice Day :)
